###Deprecated

This repo contains a first draft of a Rails project.

It was created during week 7 of the course at 
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) as a way of practicing 
the workflow and creation of various elements in the 
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) 
environment while following the first two chapters of Michael Hartl's 
[Ruby On Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
